Here visitors take in the view from the top of 20 Fenchurch Street, known as the as the Walkie-Talkie.

At more than 500 feet of elevation, the Walkie-Talkie’s “Sky Garden” is one of the highest venues of the city where people come to admire the skyline of London.

21,Bv3BUJxlKbF,"@gabrielegalimbertiphoto | Tanzania, somewhere between Ngorongoro and Serengeti - A group of teenage Maasai newly circumcised. The Maasai of Tanzania and Kenya have a series of rites of passage that accompany boys into adulthood. Every 10 or 15 years a new warrior class will be initiated into the tribe. Boys between the ages of 10 and 20 are brought together from all across the country. Dozens of houses are built that will serve as the place of initiation. The night before the ceremony, the boys sleep outside in the forest. At dawn, they return to the little makeshift homestead for a day of singing and dancing. They drink a mixture of milk, cow’s blood, and alcohol and eat piles and piles of meat. After the festivities, boys who are of age (12-16) are ready to be circumcised. The Emuratare is the most important ceremony in the life of a Maasai boy. Once circumcised, the tribe will consider him a man, warrior, and protector of his village. As the young man makes his way to where the elders will circumcise him, friends and family members will taunt the boy by saying things like “If you flinch, we will disown you.” The Maasai value bravery of their warriors and the circumcision is a boy’s first way to prove his courage in the face of severe pain. It takes about 3 months for the circumcision to heal and during that time the young men wear black clothing and live in huts built by the women of the village. The Maasai boy is now warrior. #maasai #tanzania #child",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d34d30bdf1784f47deb732ddf39be36c/5D43EC2E/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/p1080x1080/53413731_334608130527061_7491125067723926669_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&ig_cache_key=MjAxNTA4NTE0MTIwMzEzNDE0OQ%3D%3D.2,https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv3BUJxlKbF,"['child', 'maasai', 'tanzania']",jpg

36,Bvx36s2A2Uv,"@andrea_frazzetta | Milan, Italy. The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is one of the world's oldest shopping malls, built by architect Giuseppe Mengoni between 1865 and 1877 in central Milan. The four-story, double arcade Galleria was named after the first king of the Kingdom of Italy. Situated between the foothills of the Alps and the River Po, the sprawling metropolis of Milan is recognized as Italy’s financial hub and one of the world’s fashion capitals.

38,BvxOpurgTWo,"@CristinaMittermeier | There is nowhere in the world quite like the Lofoten region in northern Norway. Here, orcas are abundant, thriving by the hundreds, and swimming freely alongside their family pods. Surrounded by towering snow-capped mountains and wind-battered shorelines, these waters support a healthy population of orcas as well as a sustainable herring fishery. Right now, this ecosystem exists on a fragile balance between humans and nature - but unfortunately, this balance has repeatedly been at risk. Since 2001, the Lofoten region has been protected by a temporary ban on oil activity; however, this magical place can better serve humanity by becoming a permanent sanctuary for nature.  #FollowMe at @CristinaMittermeier to find out how you can help protect this beautiful and vulnerable region. #OilFreeLofoten #orca #Norway #conservation",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/7eec0ea5a763d524d5e750d4b25783b0/5D4B2D8A/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/54512818_462421321176075_4643279619504417290_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com&ig_cache_key=MjAxMzQ1NDk0ODY4MzAzNjA3Mg%3D%3D.2,https://www.instagram.com/p/BvxOpurgTWo,"['OilFreeLofoten', 'conservation', 'FollowMe', 'Norway', 'orca']",jpg

33,Bvy1SYlg_xG,"@ifyozoma | For a number of wildflower species, fires encourage seed germination. But the conditions that make a “superbloom” of native flowers possible - drought depriving grasses of enough water to survive, followed by heavy rains that reach deeply buried wildflower seeds - can also portend danger by encouraging the growth of invasive, fire prone flowers like yellow mustards. Living in a state that is just now recovering from a devastating fire “season”, makes knowing the above and seeing these beautifully blanketed hills both exhilarating and frightening.

One coming in from the open sea, and the other, runoff from glacial ice deep within the Icelandic highlands. The difference in color is almost so profound that it almost seems unnatural.
