## Adventure Next
Personalized adventure gallery curation harnessing the creativity of AI

## Use!
Upload a photo of an adventure you loved, or a photo of an adventure you would love to do. Adventure Next will create a custom gallery just for you of experiences and point to the National Geographic Instagram channel that match the style and subject of your submission. The entire photo will be used, so the subject should be centered.

## How it works:
A convolutional neural network extracts abstract features from the image you upload and searches the feature-space of available works of art to create a custom gallery instantly. It will present art with an overall similar shape, a similar subject, or a similar painting style. You may find results matching any or all of the categories by scrolling down the page.
