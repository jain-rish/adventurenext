Personalized adventure gallery curation harnessing the creativity of AI

Use!
Upload a photo of a piece of art you love, or a photo of a scene you would like to see painted. Art Muse will create a custom gallery just for you of art prints available for sale at fineartamerica.com that match the style and subject of your submission. The entire photo will be used, so the artwork should be centered.

How it works:
A convolutional neural network extracts abstract features from the image you upload and searches the feature-space of available works of art to create a custom gallery instantly. It will present art with an overall similar shape, a similar subject, or a similar painting style. You may find results matching any or all of the categories by scrolling down the page.
